# SoftwareCarpentryWC3
This is the Weekly Challenge 3 of SoftwareCarpentry.

(Dr.Herbol ask us to make README.md interesting and descriptive.)

It's my first time to create a website by Github. I'm really exciting about it! 

I hope in the future I can learn more about it and use it in some places.
